# Game Rules and Mechanics

## Turn-Based Actions
- The game operates in turns. Each turn, the hero can perform one or more actions, such as visiting a location, interacting with an NPC, or managing inventory.

## Resource Management
- Heroes must manage resources like health, stamina, gold, and inventory space.
- Running out of critical resources can lead to negative consequences, such as failing quests or losing reputation.

## Combat Mechanics
- While the game focuses on non-dungeon activities, some events may involve combat.
- Combat is turn-based, with heroes and enemies taking actions in order of initiative.
- Heroes can attack, use abilities, or attempt to flee.

## Death and Injury
- Heroes can be injured or killed during events or combat.
- Severe injuries may require special treatment at a temple or from specific NPCs.
- Death is permanent, requiring the player to create a new hero or load a previous save.
