# Game Project

This repository hosts the codebase for a game developed using Python with Flask/Django and MongoDB. This project is managed by a small team and aims to deliver an engaging gaming experience with a robust backend.

## Project Overview

- **Backend Framework**: Flask/Django for the server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage and management.
- **Game Logic**: Custom game rules and mechanics implemented in Python.

## Getting Started

- Python 3.8 or higher
- MongoDB
- pipenv (for Python dependency management)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourgame.git
   cd yourgame
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment and Dependencies**

   Install dependencies using pipenv:

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style.
- Use meaningful commit messages to describe your changes.

### Branching Strategy

- Use `main` for stable code.
- Create feature branches for new functionality (`feature/feature-name`).
- Submit a pull request for code review before merging.

### Testing

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory. To run tests, use:

```bash
pipenv run pytest
```

Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
